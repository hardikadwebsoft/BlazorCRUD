Blazor CRUD Operation 3-Tier Architecture with Web API Project
This project is an example of how to build a Blazor CRUD operation using a 3-tier architecture with Web API and an in-memory database. It provides a starting point for developers who want to build similar applications.

What is Blazor?
Blazor is a web framework for building interactive client-side web UIs with .NET. It allows developers to write web applications in C# instead of JavaScript, making it easier to build complex web applications.

How to Use 3-Tier Architecture with Web API and an In-Memory Database
The 3-tier architecture is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. Web API is a popular framework for building HTTP-based services using .NET. An in-memory database is a lightweight database that runs entirely in memory and is useful for testing and development purposes.

This project uses the following 3-tier architecture with Web API and an in-memory database:

Presentation layer: The presentation layer is built using Blazor, which is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.
Application layer: The application layer is built using Web API, which provides endpoints for the presentation layer to interact with the database layer.
Data layer: The data layer is built using an in-memory database, which stores the application data.
Testing
To ensure the functionality and reliability of the application, we have included unit and integration tests for both the presentation layer and the application layer.

How to Get Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Open the solution in Visual Studio
Build the solution
Run the application
By default, the project is configured to use an in-memory database. If you want to switch to a different type of database, such as SQL Server, you can modify the Startup.cs file to use a different database provider.

Conclusion
This project provides a starting point for developers who want to build Blazor CRUD operations using a 3-tier architecture with Web API and an in-memory database. It demonstrates best practices for developing web applications using .NET.
